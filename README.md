# Adversarial_Networks
Basic Generative Adversarial Network.
This is a basic generative adversarial neural network that learns to reproduce examples from the MNIST dataset.
The generative adversarial model consists of two neural networks, a generator network and a discriminator network.
The generator network generates examples that appear to the discriminator network to be real MNIST number examples.
By playing this game against each other over time, the generator learns to produce examples similar to real MNIST image examples.
